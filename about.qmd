This is a blog template for the Business Analytics program at Monash University, showcasing my projects and experience in the fields of business analytics and data science. I focus on using data-driven methods to support business decisions, with research areas including data analysis, machine learning, business process optimization, and market trend forecasting.

## Projects

### Global Cheese Market Analysis
In this project, I used data from Cheese.com to analyze the global cheese market, exploring the relationship between fat content, texture, flavor, and aroma across cheeses from different countries. The analysis revealed trends in high-fat cheese popularity in European markets and provided recommendations for market expansion.


### Customer Behavior Analysis in Retail
In this project, I analyzed customer behavior data from the retail industry, using machine learning models to identify key consumption patterns. The insights from this analysis helped improve customer experience and increase sales by optimizing marketing strategies and boosting customer loyalty.
